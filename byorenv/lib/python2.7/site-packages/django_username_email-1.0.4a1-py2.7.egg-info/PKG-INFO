Description: CUser, make email the USERNAME\_FIELD
        =====================================
        
        CUser makes it easy to use email address as your identification token
        instead of a username.
        
        CUser is a custom Django User model (extends AbstractBaseUser) so it
        takes a tiny amount of effort to use.
        
        The only difference between CUser and the vanilla Django User is email
        address is the ``USERNAME_FIELD`` (and username does not exist).
        
        Why use CUser?
        --------------
        
        Because you still want everything in ``django.contrib.auth``, but you
        also want users to **log in with email addresses**. And you don't want
        to create your own custom User model or authentication backend.
        
        Install & Set up
        ----------------
        
        0. If you previously used Django's default User model,
           ``django.contrib.auth.User``, jump to **Notes** first (then come
           back). Otherwise, continue onward!
        
        1. Install with ``pip install django-username-email``
        
        2. Add ``cuser`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:
        
           ::
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = [
                   ...
                   'cuser',
               ]
        
        3. Specify the custom model as the default user model for your project
           using the ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` setting in your settings.py:
        
           ::
        
               AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'cuser.CUser'
        
        4. Instead of referring to User directly, you should reference the user
           model using ``django.contrib.auth.get_user_model()``
        
        5. Make migrations and migrate them to create CUser's models.
        
           ::
        
               python manage.py makemigrations cuser
               python manage.py migrate
        
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        If you have tables referencing Django's User model, you will have to
        delete those table and migrations, then re-migrate. This will ensure
        everything is set up correctly from the beginning.
        
        When you define a foreign key or many-to-many relations to the User
        model, you should specify the custom model using the ``AUTH_USER_MODEL``
        setting.
        
        For example:
        
        ::
        
            from django.conf import settings
            from django.db import models
        
            class Profile(models.Model):
                user = models.ForeignKey(
                    settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
                    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            )
